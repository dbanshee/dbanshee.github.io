    text: "In a series of GhostKitchen projects, I teamed up with another student to develop a Node.js app that supports CRUD operations for processing new orders for a restaurant chain. The app has 3 versions that differ in database used for backend - one version is based on SQLite, another on MongoDB and yet another on Redis."
